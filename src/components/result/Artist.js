        "description": "Sociable, optimistic, and highly flexible, you resemble Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, a renowned French Post-Impressionist artist.\n\nHenri de Toulouse-Lautrec was the first artist to elevate advertising to the status of fine art. Lautrec was born into a French aristocrat family, but a series of childhood accidents combined with congenital health conditions permanently stunted his physical growth at a very young age. Despite his physical afflictions, Lautrec had a lovable, outgoing personality and a terrific work ethic.\n\nWith great psychological insight, Lautrec observed and documented the world of Parisian entertainment at the end of nineteenth century. Throughout his work, Lautrec often portrayed unconventional individuals in an audacious manner both frank and sympathetic.\n\nLike Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, you are living very much in the here-and-now. You have the ability to adapt to any circumstances and are also very perceptive of people around you. Due to these characteristics of you, others find you warm, sympathetic, and easygoing.\n\nYou are popular and well-liked by others, but you get bored rather quickly when things get serious. Your thirst for new experiences may lead you to develop a tendency to pursue risky behavior or the pleasures of the moment at the expense of long-term plans. Sometimes it would be helpful if you refrain from impulsive behaviors and try to focus on accomplishing long-term goals.",

        "description": "Reserved but yet highly practical and responsible, you resemble American realist painter Edward Hopper.\n\nIn his paintings, Edward Hopper captured urban loneliness and despair with the beautiful contrast of light and shade. Hopper was famous for his serious demeanor and being reticent. His wife Josephine once said, \"Sometimes talking to Eddie is just like dropping a stone in a well, except that it doesn't thump when it hits bottom.\"\n\nHopper was so reticent that he didn't even enjoy talking about his work. Rather than bragging about himself or passively following the trends, he persisted in doing what he could do best. Resisting popular trends toward Abstract Expressionism, Edward Hopper became the most important realist painter of 20th century America.\n\nLike Edward Hopper, you take great pride in your responsibility and work. You are very precise in determining what you should do or should not do to achieve your goals. But don't you feel stressed because you push yourself too hard and are tough with your own weaknesses? It would help if you reminded yourself that you don't have to be good at everything. You may also benefit from having quality time alone away from unnecessary responsibilities, plans, and even relationships.",

        "description": "Charismatic, direct, and logical, you resemble Pablo Picasso, one of the most influential artists of the 20th century.\n\nEven if you don't know anything about art, you may have heard of the name Picasso. Born in Spain, Pablo Picasso is regarded as the greatest painter in history. Throughout his career, Picasso experimented with an astonishingly wide range of styles and themes.\n\nPicasso was not only a prolific artist but also an astute businessman. He was well aware that artists cannot survive on their talent alone, especially in the market-oriented art world. To maintain his position in the market, Picasso was prepared to take a risk. Picasso understood that success could not be achieved just by appealing to the masses. Instead of pleasing the mass public, Picasso paid careful attention to delight the people who really matter, the minority tastemakers. These strategic approaches to self-branding made him the most dominant and influential artist of the 20th century.\n\nLike Pablo Picasso, you are confident, enthusiastic, and determined. You have a firm belief that there is nothing you can't achieve, given enough time and resources. Gifted with strategic intelligence, you are a leader than a follower, capable of pushing everyone else right along with them. However, you tend to remove emotions from decision-making, valuing efficiency over social proof. Because of your blunt and direct attitude, others may misinterpret your confidence as plain arrogance. If you try to be more empathetic with others and understand the different values others have, you will become a more respected leader.",

        "description": "Practical, straightforward, and adventurous, you resemble Georgia O'Keeffe, a pioneer of American Modernism.\n\nGeorgia O'Keeffe was an American artist best known for her paintings of enlarged flowers and New Mexico landscapes. Grew up on a farm in Wisconsin, O'Keeffe developed a curiosity about the natural world at a very young age. She was soon determined to become an artist, and her curiosity and unique vision towards nature later were well reflected in her paintings.\n\nAs can be observed from her large-scale paintings of flowers, O'Keeffe had a meticulous eye for details. She wanted people to take notice and experience them the same way she did. With great confidence in her art, O'Keeffe constantly fought against the imposed identity of a female artist. She once said, \"men put me down as the best woman painter… I think I'm one of the best painters\".\n\nLike Georgia O'Keeffe, you have an innate confidence in your own abilities. Curious and adventurous by nature, you are also comfortable trying new things and become more energetic when taking risks. However, you may find it difficult to deal with feelings and emotions in general. Naturally drawn to logic and factual information, you may consider emotions as an obstacle to rational thought. If you start to see the positive sides of emotions, it will help you become a more integrated person.",

Salvador Dalí has long been revered as an iconic Surrealist artist. Dalí possessed immense talent and fearless creativity. Heavily influenced by Sigmund Freud, he hoped to liberate the unconscious mind through his artwork.\n\nSalvador Dalí is also known as a master of self-promotion. Due to his eccentric behaviors, Dalí was always at the center of journalists' attention. He was well aware that the relations with media were the key to an artist's self-branding. His outstanding talent, combined with the effort to self-promotion, had contributed to building Dalí's career, which expanded over six decades and encompassed an extraordinary range of media, including painting, film, graphic arts, and sculpture.\n\nLike Salvador Dalí, you feel most alive when you are authentically expressing yourself and connecting with others. You are good at understanding what other people are feeling and precisely know how to please them. You are also very sensitive to what people are feeling for you. Even if you may appear to be fearless and confident, deep inside, you constantly seek approval from others. Sometimes you may need to remind yourself that you don't always have to be wanted and appreciated. If you let yourself detach a bit from others' opinions, you will become more emotionally secure.",

Born in Brooklyn, Basquiat emerged from New York's graffiti scene as part of the street art duo SAMO in the 1970s. Basquiat left a shocking piece of work dealing with topics of graffiti, racism, cartoons, black heroes, autobiographical stories, and death. Drew inspiration from his upbringing and heritage, Basquiat was never shy of commenting explicitly upon racial injustice in America.\n\nLike Basquiat, you can speak with great passion, especially when standing up for your ideals. Having creativity, imagination, and sensitivity as your strengths, you have the ability to take your idealism and translate it into action. You are also sensitive to the needs of others and can be very empathetic to their emotions. However, at the same time, you may find it difficult to open up yourself to others. You rarely ask for help simply because you don't want to burden or bother others with your issues. These gestures may hold you back or create distance in your relationships. It would be helpful if you realize asking for help isn't a sign of weakness, but it has many positive sides, including building trust and facilitating further development.",

Struggle, conflict, oppression, and the abuse of power are the themes he explored in his works. Golub often painted on unprimed massive canvas with thick brushstrokes, which allowed his paintings to have a remarkable presence with sculptural and tapestry-like qualities. Through his art, Golub wanted to get a rise out of people. He understood the gap between being an artist and activist and strived to bring art and politics together.\n\nLike Leon Golub, you are constantly trying to make the world a better place. Unafraid to stand up and speak when something needs to be said, you take great pleasure in inspiring and helping people. However, at the same time, you are highly sensitive to other people's reactions. Since you care a lot about what others think, you are likely to feel disappointed with yourself when you're critiqued.

In 1925, Kahlo was involved in a serious bus accident. Left her with lifelong pain, the accident profoundly changed her life and art. However, Kahlo didn't let pain crash her. She transformed her pain into fuel for art, which became her means for survival.\n\nFrida Kahlo always kept her focus on the present instead of wondering what may happen in the future. This tendency was well reflected in her painting as she once said, \"I paint always whatever passes through my head, without any other considerations.\" Kahlo never also sought to be anything more than she was. All she wanted to do was be true to herself and reflect on her own reality through her paintings.\n\nLike Frida Kahlo, you are focused on the present moment with a strong sense of your surroundings. You are also sensitive to people's needs and fairly flexible at accepting others as they are. Though you appreciate personal space, you know the joy of building meaningful connections with people.
