    "description": "Reserved, creative, and attentive, you resemble Frida Kahlo, one of Mexico's greatest artists.\n\nFrida Kahlo is renowned for her self-portraits, a symbolic expression of her own pain and sexuality. In 1925, Kahlo was involved in a serious bus accident. Left her with lifelong pain, the accident profoundly changed her life and art. However, Kahlo didn't let pain crash her. She transformed her pain into fuel for art, which became her means for survival.\n\nLike Frida Kahlo, you are focused on the present moment with a strong sense of your surroundings. You are also sensitive to people's needs and fairly flexible at accepting others as they are. Though you appreciate personal space, you know the joy of building meaningful connections with people. However, when conflict arises, you tend to walk away from the situation or from the person rather than trying to resolve the issues. You may benefit from learning the art of conflict management, perceiving conflicts as a potential for learning opportunities, or strengthening relationships rather than chaos breaking harmony.",
