    "description": "Sociable, highly flexible, and optimistic, you resemble Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, a renowned French Post-Impressionist artist.\n\nHenri de Toulouse-Lautrec was the first artist to elevate advertising to the status of fine art. Toulouse-Lautrec was born into a French aristocrat family, but a series of childhood accidents combined with congenital health conditions permanently stunted his physical growth at a very young age. Despite his physical afflictions, Toulouse-Lautrec had a lovable, outgoing personality and a terrific work ethic.\n\nWith great psychological insight, Toulouse-Lautrec observed and documented facets of Parisian nightlife and the French world of entertainment in the 1890s. Throughout his work, Toulouse-Lautrec often portrayed unconventional individuals in an audacious manner both frank and sympathetic.\n\nLiving very much in the here-and-now, you have the ability to adapt to any circumstances. With a strong awareness of your surroundings, you are also very perceptive and understanding of other people around you. Due to these characteristics of you, others find you warm, sympathetic, and easygoing.\n\nYou are popular and well-liked by others, but you become easily bored rather quickly when things get serious. Your thirst for new experiences may lead you to develop a tendency to pursue risky behavior or the pleasures of the moment at the expense of long-term plans. Sometimes it would be helpful if you refrain from impulsive and spontaneous behaviors and try to establish and accomplish long-term goals.",

    "date": "Frida Kahlo (1907-1954)",
    "description": "Reserved, creative, and attentive, you resemble Frida Kahlo, one of Mexico's greatest artists.\n\nFrida Kahlo is renowned for her self-portraits, a symbolic expression of her own pain and sexuality. In 1925, Kahlo was involved in a serious bus accident. Left her with lifelong pain, the accident profoundly changed her life and art. However, Kahlo didn't let pain crash her. She transformed her pain into fuel for art, which became her means for survival.\n\nLike Frida Kahlo, you are focused on the present moment with a strong sense of your surroundings. You are also sensitive to people's needs and fairly flexible at accepting others as they are. Though you appreciate personal space, you know the joy of building meaningful connections with people. However, when conflict arises, you tend to walk away from the situation or from the person rather than trying to resolve the issues. You may benefit from learning the art of conflict management, perceiving conflicts as a potential for learning opportunities, or strengthening relationships rather than chaos breaking harmony.",
