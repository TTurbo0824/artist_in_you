Resisting popular trends toward Abstract Expressionism, Edward Hopper became the most important realist painter of 20th century America.\\n\\nLike Edward Hopper, you take great pride in your responsibility and work.

Throughout his career, Picasso experimented with an astonishingly wide range of styles and themes.\\n\\nPicasso was not only a prolific artist but also an astute businessman. He was well aware that artists cannot survive on their talent alone, especially in the market-oriented art world. To maintain his position in the market, Picasso was prepared to take a risk. Picasso understood that success could not be achieved just by appealing to the masses. Instead of pleasing the mass public, Picasso paid careful attention to delight the people who really matter, the minority tastemakers. These strategic approaches to self-branding made him the most dominant and influential artist of the 20th century.\\n\\nLike Pablo Picasso, you are confident, enthusiastic, and determined. You have a firm belief that there is nothing you can't achieve, given enough time and resources. Gifted with strategic intelligence, you are a leader than a follower, capable of pushing everyone else right along with them.

She was soon determined to become an artist, and her curiosity and unique vision towards nature later were well reflected in her paintings.\\n\\nAs can be observed from her large-scale paintings of flowers, O'Keeffe had a meticulous eye for details. She wanted people to take notice and experience them the same way she did. With great confidence in her art, O'Keeffe constantly fought against the imposed identity of a female artist. She once said, \\\"men put me down as the best woman painter… I think I'm one of the best painters\\\".\\n\\nLike Georgia O'Keeffe, you have an innate confidence in your own abilities.

Drew inspiration from his upbringing and heritage, Basquiat was never shy of commenting explicitly upon racial injustice in America.\\n\\nLike Basquiat, you can speak with great passion, especially when standing up for your ideals. Having creativity, imagination, and sensitivity as your strengths, you have the ability to take your idealism and translate it into action. You are also sensitive to the needs of others and can be very empathetic to their emotions. However, at the same time, you may find it difficult to open up yourself to others. You rarely ask for help simply because you don't want to burden or bother others with your issues. These gestures may hold you back or create distance in your relationships.

Unafraid to stand up and speak when something needs to be said, you take great pleasure in inspiring and helping people. However, at the same time, you are highly sensitive to other people's reactions. Since you care a lot about what others think, you are likely to feel disappointed with yourself when you're critiqued.
