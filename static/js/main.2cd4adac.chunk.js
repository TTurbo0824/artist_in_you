Lautrec was born into a French aristocrat family, but a series of childhood accidents combined with congenital health conditions permanently stunted his physical growth at a very young age. Despite his physical afflictions, Lautrec had a lovable, outgoing personality and a terrific work ethic.\n\nWith great psychological insight, Lautrec observed and documented the world of Parisian entertainment at the end of nineteenth century. Throughout his work, Lautrec often portrayed unconventional individuals in an audacious manner both frank and sympathetic.\n\nLike Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, you are living very much in the here-and-now. You have the ability to adapt to any circumstances and are also very perceptive of people around you. Due to these characteristics of you, others find you warm, sympathetic, and easygoing.\n\nYou are popular and well-liked by others, but you get bored rather quickly when things get serious.

His wife Josephine once said, \"Sometimes talking to Eddie is just like dropping a stone in a well, except that it doesn't thump when it hits bottom.\"\n\nHopper was so reticent that he didn't even enjoy talking about his work. Rather than bragging about himself or passively following the trends, he persisted in doing what he could do best. Resisting popular trends toward Abstract Expressionism, Edward Hopper became the most important realist painter of 20th century America.\n\nLike Edward Hopper, you take great pride in your responsibility and work. You are very precise in determining what you should do or should not do to achieve your goals. But don't you feel stressed because you push yourself too hard and are tough with your own weaknesses?

Born in Spain, Pablo Picasso is regarded as the greatest painter in history. Throughout his career, Picasso experimented with an astonishingly wide range of styles and themes.\n\nPicasso was not only a prolific artist but also an astute businessman. He was well aware that artists cannot survive on their talent alone, especially in the market-oriented art world. To maintain his position in the market, Picasso was prepared to take a risk. Picasso understood that success could not be achieved just by appealing to the masses. Instead of pleasing the mass public, Picasso paid careful attention to delight the people who really matter, the minority tastemakers. These strategic approaches to self-branding made him the most dominant and influential artist of the 20th century.\n\nLike Pablo Picasso, you are confident, enthusiastic, and determined. You have a firm belief that there is nothing you can't achieve, given enough time and resources. Gifted with strategic intelligence, you are a leader than a follower, capable of pushing everyone else right along with them. However, you tend to remove emotions from decision-making, valuing efficiency over social proof. Because of your blunt and direct attitude, others may misinterpret your confidence as plain arrogance.

She was soon determined to become an artist, and her curiosity and unique vision towards nature later were well reflected in her paintings.\n\nAs can be observed from her large-scale paintings of flowers, O'Keeffe had a meticulous eye for details. She wanted people to take notice and experience them the same way she did. With great confidence in her art, O'Keeffe constantly fought against the imposed identity of a female artist. She once said, \"men put me down as the best woman painter\u2026 I think I'm one of the best painters\".\n\nLike Georgia O'Keeffe, you have an innate confidence in your own abilities.

Drew inspiration from his upbringing and heritage, Basquiat was never shy of commenting explicitly upon racial injustice in America.\n\nLike Basquiat, you can speak with great passion, especially when standing up for your ideals. Having creativity, imagination, and sensitivity as your strengths, you have the ability to take your idealism and translate it into action. You are also sensitive to the needs of others and can be very empathetic to their emotions. However, at the same time, you may find it difficult to open up yourself to others. You rarely ask for help simply because you don't want to burden or bother others with your issues. These gestures may hold you back or create distance in your relationships.

Struggle, conflict, oppression, and the abuse of power are the themes he explored in his works. Golub often painted on unprimed massive canvas with thick brushstrokes, which allowed his paintings to have a remarkable presence with sculptural and tapestry-like qualities. Through his art, Golub wanted to get a rise out of people. He understood the gap between being an artist and activist and strived to bring art and politics together.\n\nLike Leon Golub, you are constantly trying to make the world a better place. Unafraid to stand up and speak when something needs to be said, you take great pleasure in inspiring and helping people. However, at the same time, you are highly sensitive to other people's reactions. Since you care a lot about what others think, you are likely to feel disappointed with yourself when you're critiqued.

She transformed her pain into fuel for art, which became her means for survival.\n\nFrida Kahlo always kept her focus on the present instead of wondering what may happen in the future. This tendency was well reflected in her painting as she once said, \"I paint always whatever passes through my head, without any other considerations.\" Kahlo never also sought to be anything more than she was. All she wanted to do was be true to herself and reflect on her own reality through her paintings.\n\nLike Frida Kahlo, you are focused on the present moment with a strong sense of your surroundings.
